What We Would Have Done Differently:
Reflecting on the integration process, we wish we had designed the overall game 
functionality with clearer separation between the logic that chooses 
a card and the logic that executes playing it. This would have help very much 
with understanding and wokring on our providers code. This small change could 
have streamlined our logic, made our controller more flexible, and eased the 
process of adapting our code to different view or model implementations. From 
seeing how well-structured and modular the provided code was, we also learned 
the importance of focusing on reusable UI components and keeping communication
between parts of the system as straightforward as possible so that in the future 
we deisgn GUIs better.

Experience With Providers:
Working with the providers was a overall positive experience. They delivered a 
a well organized codebase with a neat directory and even provided a video demo that 
clarified how their gameplay elements were intended to function and what their view 
looked like. Their approach to structuring the project made it much easier to integrate 
their code into our own implementation, and they have helpful documentation and 
communicated when we were confused. We would certainly look forward to working with them 
again.
