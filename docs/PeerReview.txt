Design Critique:
The provider’s code generally reflects good architectural decisions, 
mainly through the solid design using MVC principles and the extension of 
JPanel for both the board and hand panels. These choices enhance modularity and make 
the UI components easier to maintain and evolve. However, the decision to have the 
play method accept a cell object, rather than using a hand index to identify which 
card to play, complicates integration with other systems. And the controller did not 
have callback methods to notify the controller manager of the actions taken. This 
approach increases coupling between the view and controller, making it less intuitive 
and flexible.

Implementation Critique:
From an implementation standpoint, the code is well-structured and follows good 
coding conventions. The integration of Swing components is logical, 
and the separation between the classes is clear. Still, tying the play 
function so closely to cell objects, rather than indices, diminishes the 
controller’s adaptability. Without a more standard interface for handling 
actions, we found it challenging to build upon the existing functionality 
using the adapter design pattern.

Documentation Critique: 
The code is well-documented at a high level, with helpful Javadoc comments and 
clear explanations of class responsibilities. Nonetheless, the documentation should 
better explain complex design decisions, such as why cells are passed directly into 
the play method or why no callback methods exist for the controller manager. Improved 
explanations would enable other developers like us to understand the rationale behind these 
choices and adapt the code more confidently without having to edit our own code heavily.

Design/Code Limitations & Suggestions: 
To address these issues, we would ask this team to consider revising the play method 
signature to accept a hand index instead of a cell object. This change would reduce 
coupling and make the controller easier to integrate with other systems. Additionally, 
introducing callback mechanisms or observer patterns would allow the controller to 
communicate more effectively with a controller manager, enabling better handling 
of asynchronous events. Lastly, having a more through Javadoc would be helpful, and 
even in-line comments in the view implementation would be beneficial.
